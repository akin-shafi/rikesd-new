                    Answering these questions and more, An Illustrated Guide to Clinical Psychology is ideal for

                    Written by clinical psychologists, and featuring illustrations by one of the authors, Juliet
                    Young,
                    this
                    accessible book explores the history and context of clinical psychology, the key skills, tools,
                    and
                    theoretical
                    foundations for clinical psychologists, and the main therapeutic approaches that they use. The
                    book
                    navigates
                    through the necessary components to understand the underpinning elements of the profession, with
                    a
                    taster of
                    different areas that clinical psychologists work in. Through a critical lens, it also explores
                    topical
                    debates
                    within the profession and addresses issues of diversity and inclusion.
