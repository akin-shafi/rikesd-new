            <h5>How We Collect, Process, Use, and Share Personal Data</h5>
            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>We may collect your Personal Data through forms, email and physical requests, cookies, JWT, web tokens, or third-party applications. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies or to alert you if we access cookies. However, please note that disabling or refusing cookies may result in some parts of this Website becoming inaccessible or not functioning properly.</p>

                <p>We use your Personal Data for the following purposes: verification of your identity; human resources management; access to computer systems and third-party software; know-your-customer and due diligence purposes; recruitment purposes; regulatory compliance; performance of a contract with you; compliance with legal obligations; marketing; litigation; events planning and hosting; in-house security; research, analysis, and other business purposes or legitimate interests.</p>

                <p>When you send us email or other communications, we may retain those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, or improve our services provided on our Platform.

            <h5>Consent and Access Rights</h5>

            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>We will obtain your consent prior to collecting or processing your Personal Data. If we intend to use the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected, we will request your consent before such use.</p>

                <p>Please note that no consent shall be sought, given, or accepted in any circumstance that may propagate direct or indirect atrocities, hate, child rights violation, criminal acts, and anti-social conduct.</p>

                <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and may request access to your Personal Data in our possession. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your Personal Data prior to the withdrawal. However, we may deny your access request if we determine it to be unreasonable.</p>

                <p>You also have the right to request the modification or amendment of your Personal Data in our possession. For all access or modification requests related to Personal Data, we will request sufficient identification to confirm that you are the owner of the data in question.</p>

                <p>If you provide the Personal Data of a third party to us, you confirm that you have informed the owner of the data about the purpose for which it is required and obtained their consent to provide the data to us for that purpose, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            </div>

            </ol>
            </div>

            <p>Please be aware that upon the transfer of information outside Nigeria, some data protection principles may be violated in the receiving country. By consenting to the processing of your Personal Data, you also consent to the transfer of your Personal Data outside Nigeria.</p>

            <h5>Retention of Personal Data</h5>

            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it. This includes complying with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. If there is a complaint or a prospect of litigation in relation to our relationship with you, we may retain your Personal Data for a longer period. In such cases, any retained information will be safeguarded in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process the data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as any applicable legal, regulatory, reporting, or other requirements.</p>

                <p>If any information is retained in an encrypted format, we will also take measures for secure storage of the encryption keys, which will be retained as long as the data they decrypt is retained.</p>

                <p>In some circumstances, we may anonymize your Personal Data for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may retain and use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
            </div>

            <h5>Violations</h5>

            <div class="pl-6">
                <p>We take swift action to remedy any suspected breaches of Personal Data. However, we will not be responsible for any breach of Personal Data that occurs as a result of events beyond our control, acts of terrorism, acts of God (including but not limited to fires, explosions, earthquakes, floods, epidemics, or pandemics) that compromise our data protection measures, war, hostilities, invasion, act of foreign enemies, requisition, embargo, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power, or civil war that compromises our data protection measures, the transfer of your Personal Data to a third party on your instructions, or the use of your Personal Data by a third party designated by you.</p>

            </div>

            <h5>Your Legal Rights</h5>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>

            <!-- Nex -->
            <div class="pl-4">
            <ol>
                <li>Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and verify that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                <li>Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
                <li>Request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing, where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. However, note that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                <li>Object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                <li>Request restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios:
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
                        <li>Where you need us to hold the data, even if we no longer require it, as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</li>
                        <li>You have objected to our use of your Personal Data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party. We will provide your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format to you or a third party you have chosen. This right applies only to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>

            </ol>
            </div>
            
            <p>
            If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above or have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact the Data Protection Officer at the contact information provided above.
            </p>


            <h5>You will not have to pay a fee to:</h5>

            <div class="pl-4">
                <ol>
                    <li>Access your Personal Data.</li>
                    <li>Change your Personal Data provided to us.</li>
                    <li>Exercise any of your other rights.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>Notwithstanding the above, we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to comply with your request if your requests are clearly unfounded, repetitive, excessive, or if any criminal or illegal activity is suspected. Additionally, if you request to change your Personal Data in our possession more than three (3) times within a 12-month period, we may charge a fee or refuse to comply with your request.</p>

            <p>To help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or exercise any other rights), we may need to request specific information from you. This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any unauthorized person. We may also contact you to request further information to expedite our response.</p>

            <p>We strive to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. However, in some cases, particularly if your request is complex or if you have made multiple requests, it may take us longer to respond. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>


            <h5>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h5>
            
            <p>We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Please keep us informed if your Personal Data changes during your relationship with us.</p>
