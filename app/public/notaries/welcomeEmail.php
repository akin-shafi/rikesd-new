Dear [first name],
<div>Welcome to our e-notary community.</div>
<p>
	<p>
		Our mission is to create a world where every document shared can be trusted.<br />
	</p>

	<p>
	We’re building a platform that helps people notarise documents and swear affidavits virtually. Our online platform will be going live soon and will securely connect our clients with trusted notaries public such as you to validate documents and witness sworn affidavits in real-time.
	</p>

	<p>
	We’re running a pilot programme, and we’re already helping loads of users with their notary needs offline and would love for you to be a member of our community.
	</p>

	<p>
	Now that you’ve met the requirements and your listing in our e-notary community is approved, here’s how it works.<br />
	</p>

	<div>
	1.	You will be contacted from time to time to confirm your availability to notarise documents by hosting virtual notary sessions where necessary.<br /><br />
	
	2.	Clients’ documents along with their relevant ID will be shared with you for review prior to every session.<br /><br />

	3.	You will host successful notary sessions.<br /><br />

	4.	You will send clients’ notarised documents or affidavits to them by email immediately with RikeSD in copy, or you will cooperate with RikeSD’s operations team to facilitate physical delivery to clients if they chose that option.<br /><br />

	5.	You will receive full payment following every successful notary session with a client.<br /><br />

	We encourage our notaries to treat every request diligently and turn them into successful transactions.<br /><br />
	For any other enquiry or further assistance, please feel free to respond to this email or call the number below.
