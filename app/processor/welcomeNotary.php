                    Our mission is to create a world where every document shared can be trusted.<br />
                </p>

                Now that youâ€™ve met the requirements and your listing in our e-notary
                community is approved, hereâ€™s how it works.
                </p>

                <p>
                1. You will be contacted from time to time to confirm your availability to
                notarise   documents   by   hosting   virtual   notary   sessions   where
                necessary.
                </p>

                <p>
                2. Clientsâ€™ documents along with their relevant ID will be shared with you
                for review prior to every session.
                </p>

                <p>
                3. You will be able to host successful notary sessions via zoom calls.
                </p>

                <p>
                4. Full payment would be made following every successful notary session
                with a client. As a partner with us, you will be able to earn: 
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A flat rate of N5000 per Notary Session </li>
                    <li>A sum of N2500 for an additional seal/document copy </li>
                    <li>A sum of N1000 for affidavits; for the various affidavit use cases. </li>
                    <li>A Custom and pre-agreed fee for high transaction documents   </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                We encourage our notaries to treat every request diligently and turn them
                into successful transactions.
